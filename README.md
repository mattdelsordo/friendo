# friendo-dev
A devkit for Friendo (a virtual pal).

Friendo is my attempt to make a web-based virtual pal out of simple JavaScript, that can be run purely client-side or locally in a browser. This devkit is my playground for implementation of core features before I create the actual game. Stay tuned (I say almost a year and a half after beginning this project)!
