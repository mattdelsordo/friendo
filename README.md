## Friendo

A Friendo is a virtual pal. Hatch your Friendo from an egg, care for it, and schedule its exercise regimen until it becomes the big strong Friendo it was destined to be. Friendos grow, learn, get stronger, and adopt more dogs as you increase their stats. Make a new friend at **https://mattdelsordo.github.io/friendo/** and see how powerful your bond will become!

#### Motivation
Friendo is a little pet project to make a simple browser game with as few JS dependencies as possible (right now, really just Bootstrap to help with CSS) that runs exclusively in the browser, hosted with Github Pages. My goal is to do things in the most Best Practices (tm) way possible as an exercise, so there's going to be a lot of refactoring and updating of the development setup. Game-wise, I'm inspired by stuff like Cookie Clicker and Tamagotchi and want to see how much gameplay I can eke out of a minimum of actual features.
